# DALAS Project 

How is Art Valued? 🎨

## 📌 Overview
The **DALAS Project** (Determining Artistic Level and Aesthetic Significance) is an exploration into the complex world of art valuation. The project seeks to determine **how art is valued** based on three core parameters:

1. **Technique & Skill** - The execution, mastery, and complexity of the artwork.
2. **Beauty & Aesthetics** - The "wow" factor that makes a piece visually compelling.
3. **Story & Concept** - The meaning, originality, and depth behind the artwork.

We will use **data analysis and computational models** to quantify and analyze these factors, providing a systematic approach to evaluating artwork.

## 🏗 Project Structure
The project consists of **two main parts**:
- **Web Scraping Module**: Automatically collects artwork images and metadata (e.g., upvotes) from platforms like Reddit.
- **Evaluation Functions**: Implements algorithms to assess the three core parameters and determine an artwork's value.


## 🎯 Parameters for Art Evaluation

### **1️⃣ Technique & Skill ("How" the Art is Made)**
The technical aspect focuses on **execution, mastery, and effort** behind an artwork. It includes:
- **Medium Complexity**: How difficult the medium is to use (e.g., oil vs. pencil).
- **Skill Level**: The precision and control demonstrated.
- **Time Investment**: How long the artwork took to create.
- **Scale/Size**: Larger pieces often have a higher perceived value.
- **Uniqueness of the Technique**: Whether the technique is common, uncommon, or unique.


### **2️⃣ Beauty & Aesthetics ("The Wow Factor")**
Visual appeal is crucial in determining how an artwork is perceived. This factor includes:
- **Composition**: How well elements are arranged.
- **Color Palette**: The effectiveness of color choices.
- **Detail & Intricacy**: The level of fine detail present.
- **Overall Impact**: The "gut feeling" an artwork gives the viewer.


### **3️⃣ Story & Concept ("The Why" Behind the Art)**
Art is more than just visuals; the meaning behind it adds depth. This aspect evaluates:
- **Concept Depth**: How strong and meaningful the idea behind the artwork is.
- **Originality**: Whether the concept is fresh and innovative.
- **Personal Connection**: The emotional weight and personal significance.
- **Narrative Clarity**: How well the story or message is communicated.

## 🛠 Features & Implementation
✅ **Web Scraping:**
- Collects images and metadata from Reddit's /r/Art.
- Saves images with filenames corresponding to their upvote count.

✅ **Automated Image Analysis:**
- Functions to assess art based on the above parameters.
- Uses Machine Learning and Statistical Analysis to determine **the relative weight of each characteristic**.

✅ **Data Science & Insights:**
- Extensive **data analysis** to compare how different characteristics influence an artwork's popularity and value.
